    <h1 class="title">Nick Wyatt - Music Teacher</h1>
    <p class="para">I have been dedicated to music for the past 15 years of my life and have been working professionally for over 5. After graduating from The BRIT School I went on to study Music at the University of Surrey where I received first class honours. My career involves teaching and also both performing and composing in the industry.</p>
    <p class="para"> I have always made it my mision to ensure music is accessible to all. I welcome both new starting students and those at advanced levels. I seek to ensure every lesson is both engaging and informative, whatever your ability or age.</p>
